    <h2>Emanuel Mu√±oz Torigino</h2>
    <h2>Some friends called me just Ema, or Manu</h2>
    <p>I was a member of the church of Jesus Christ since i was 8 years old because my parents are members too, they teach me the true gospel and I believed. I love to be part of the church, something that like me a lot is the opportunity everyone have to be change by Jesus Christ and His gospel.
    </p>
    <p>I was a missionary from 2020 to 2022 (on the pandemic) in Lima, Peru. I am the younger of my 4 siblings, one sister and 3 brothers and all of them and my parents also served a mission</p>
    <p>Right now I am 23 years old and things that I loved are go to gym, learn more about programming, playing soccer with my friends and listen a lot of diferent music but i love electronic like "Alan Walker" or rap.</p> 
    <p>I hope all of you be comfortable to the course this semester, i am excited to know some of you and start a new project if is possible to acquire new skills and make easier learn together.</p>

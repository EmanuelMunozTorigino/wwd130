                    I try to be reesponsible and attentive with others.
                    In high school attended to a technical school focused
                    on computer and electromechanics so from young people
                    
                    I was in contact with technology and different inovations
                    that are most continuously known in today's world.

                    My first participation with the programming was working with arduino
                    manufacturing different simple projects for sliding doors to remote hinder.

                    but it was not until i graduated and started the university in 2022 that
                    interests me even more in software development, i love new technologies
                    such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, which i hope in its 
                    due moment to know more deeply, as well as the Full Stack web development, 
                    which is what I am currently focusing on. I currently continue learning the 
                    foundations of HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript which I will learn even 
                    more deeply in the race: Software Development Development of the Briham 
                    Young University at the Idago headquarters, United States, through the 
                    Byu-Pathway program that It allows studying online. I am always ready to 
                    learn new concepts and good programming practices, I long to be a clean, 
                    simple and clear developer when creating quality software to solve and meet 
                    the different users' needs.

        Thanks for visiting me, it is a pleasure to have you here,

        I'm Emanuel Muñoz Torigino,
        I live in the north of Buenos Aires, Argentina, I am 23 years old, I love to serve, work as a team, I try to be responsible and attentive with others.
        In high school concur to a technical school focused on computer and electromechanics so from young people I was in contact with technology and different invations that are most continuously known in today's world. My first participation with the programming was working with Arduino plates manufacturing different simple projects, from sliding doors to remote hinders. But it was not until I graduated and started the university in 2022 that interests me even more in software development. I love new technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, which I hope in its due moment to know more deeply, as well as the Full Stack web development, which is what I am currently focusing on. I currently continue learning the foundations of HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript which I will learn even more deeply in the race: Software Development Development of the Briham Young University at the Idago headquarters, United States, through the Byu-Pathway program that It allows studying online.

        I am always ready to learn new concepts and good programming practices, I long to be a clean, simple and clear developer when creating quality software to solve and meet the different users' needs.

        My experience as a developer began with Python language at the University to perform various simple tasks of current real problems,
        And then I started with web development, learning and applying the foundations of HTML and CSS with which I hope to continue improving and performing more and more personal and collaborative projection.
